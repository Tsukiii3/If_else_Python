#  If_else_Python

**Python Beginner Projects Collection**

This repository contains a collection of **beginner-friendly Python programs** created to practice fundamental programming concepts. The projects focus mainly on **conditional logic (`if / elif / else`)**, along with user input, arithmetic operations, simple games, and real-life problem solving.

---

##  Contents

The scripts in this repository help reinforce core Python concepts, such as:

* Input and output handling
* Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Arithmetic operations
* Randomization
* Basic logic and decision-making
* Simple user interaction via terminal
